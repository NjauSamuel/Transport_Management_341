# THE FOLLOWING IS OUR PROBLEM STATEMENT

The system that I want to design is for our universities transport department
and it is to help them out to automate their processes, and so the first step I
want is to design their database to help them out.

The first step of the process.

At the begining of the semester, the Timetableing departments writes to the
Chair of Departments (COD's) asking if there are any trips in their departments.

The second step of the process:

The COD's write back to the TimeTabling in response to the step 1 above and in
this write up there has to be indicated the

-  Place of visit.
-  The Budget.
-  The purpose of their visit.
-  The Unit involved.
-  The date of their visit.

The COD must consult his lecturures and should state whethere they will spend
the night.

The Step 3:

The director of the Timetabling department compiles provisional Trips list to
the Deputy Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs (DVC AA) who approves this list.

Step 4:

After the approval of this list, the Director for TimeTabling compiles this list
again.

Step 5:

The director for Timetabling then advices the Transport Manager of the Transport
department to provide viehicles for the said data. It could be a 56 bus seater
or even a 14 seater minibus or even both plus other buses depending on the size
of the travelling people.

Step 6:

The lecturure in charge of the students then applies for funds from the (DVC
AA).

Step 7(final step):

The final list is then copied / shared to Registrar AA (Acadaming Affairs), DVC
APD, all COD's and the Transport Manager.
